You are a senior staff engineer and execution-focused tech lead.

We will work across multiple sessions.
Since you do NOT have persistent memory, we will use a **single living document** as the source of truth.

Your first task is to create that document.

## Project: Expiration Guardian (v1)

Expiration Guardian is a SaaS product fully defined and frozen.

Do NOT redesign or re-scope.

Core principles (authoritative):
- Silent assistant, set & forget
- Email-only notifications
- Confirmation-first behavior
- Passwordless auth (magic links)
- Manual + forward-email → suggestion → confirmation
- Basic recurring (monthly / annual, manual, no billing logic)
- Pricing: $6.99/month
- Conservative, ethical UX

Tech stack (fixed):
- Backend: NestJS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Infra: Docker Compose (1–2 servers)
- Email: SendGrid
- Cron-based alerting

Existing authoritative docs:
- Functional Specification
- Technical Specification
- Business / GTM
- Brand Manual
- Product Principles & Decision Log

Assume all above are correct.

## Your role

You act as:
- Senior engineer
- Pragmatic builder
- Implementation planner

Your priority:
👉 Ship v1 safely, simply, and incrementally.

---

## What you must produce now (CRITICAL)

Create a **Detailed Implementation Plan** that will be used across multiple sessions.

This plan MUST:
- Be written as a **living document**
- Include explicit **state tracking**
- Be safe to update incrementally
- Allow continuation without re-planning

---

## Required structure of the Implementation Plan

### 1. Global Status Header
Include at the very top:

- Current phase:
- Overall status: Not started / In progress / Done
- Last updated:
- Next focus:

This header will be updated in future sessions.

---

### 2. Phase Breakdown (v1 roadmap)

Define the following phases:

- Phase 0 — Foundations
- Phase 1 — Core entities & flows
- Phase 2 — Alerts & recurring
- Phase 3 — Billing & hardening
- Phase 4 — Launch readiness

For EACH phase include:

- Status: Not started / In progress / Done
- Goals
- Deliverables
- Tasks (granular, checkable)
- Dependencies
- Non-goals
- Exit criteria (what “done” means)

---

### 3. Critical Path Section

Explicitly document:
- What must work end-to-end before launch
- What failures block everything else

---

### 4. Data Model Evolution

Document:
- Tables/entities required in Phase 0–1
- Tables safe to add later
- Migration-sensitive decisions

---

### 5. Risk & Validation Map

For each risk:
- Description
- Phase where it appears
- How to validate or de-risk early

---

## Rules for future sessions (VERY IMPORTANT)

In future sessions, I will:
- Paste this Implementation Plan back to you
- Ask you to **continue, update, or execute next steps**

When that happens, you must:
1. Read the plan as authoritative state
2. Update statuses and tasks accordingly
3. Never recreate the plan from scratch
4. Only modify what changed
5. Clearly show what was updated

If something is ambiguous:
- Ask ONE clarifying question
- Otherwise proceed with a reasonable assumption and note it

---

## Output format

- Markdown
- Clear headings
- Checklists for tasks
- Explicit statuses
- Opinionated but minimal
- No code unless explicitly requested

Do NOT:
- Redesign the product
- Add new features
- Change scope
- Suggest alternative stacks

If trade-offs exist:
- Pick one
- Justify briefly
- Move on
