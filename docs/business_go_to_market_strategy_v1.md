# Business, Marketing & Go-To-Market Strategy – Expiration Guardian v1

## 1. Executive Summary

Expiration Guardian is a low-cost, high-volume SaaS designed to solve a universal but underserved problem: **forgetting important expirations**.

The business is intentionally built around:
- A simple value proposition
- Cheap subscription pricing
- High automation
- Low support and operational overhead

The strategy prioritizes **clarity, trust, and distribution efficiency** over aggressive feature expansion.

---

## 2. Value Proposition

### Core Promise

> *Never miss what matters.*

Expiration Guardian removes cognitive load from managing expirations by acting as a silent assistant that monitors dates and notifies users at the right time.

### Why Users Pay
- Avoid fines, stress, and last-minute emergencies
- Peace of mind for critical documents and services
- No dashboards to manage, no learning curve

---

## 3. Target Market

### Primary Market

**Individuals**:
- Freelancers
- Immigrants
- Solo founders
- Families managing documents and services

Characteristics:
- High volume
- Low willingness to pay individually
- Strong word-of-mouth potential

### Secondary Market

**Small businesses (1–10 people)**:
- Informal compliance needs
- Shared visibility via email
- Upgrade path to higher tiers later

---

## 4. Market Size (Qualitative)

The problem space is horizontal and non-verticalized:
- Every adult manages expirations
- Every household has recurring services
- Every small business has renewals

This enables:
- Broad messaging
- Multiple acquisition channels
- Long-term expansion into vertical plans

---

## 5. Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Model
- Subscription-based
- $6.99 per month
- Annual plan with ~20% discount

### Rationale
- Low enough to be an impulse purchase
- High enough to signal seriousness and reliability
- Compatible with high-volume acquisition

### Free Trial
- 14 days
- No credit card required
- Paywall triggered by limits, not time alone

---

## 6. Unit Economics (Target)

- Low infrastructure costs (email + cron-based jobs)
- Minimal human support
- High gross margin at scale

Target outcomes:
- Break-even at low thousands of users
- Strong profitability via volume, not ARPU

---

## 7. Acquisition Strategy

### Primary Channels (v1)

#### 1. Content & SEO
- Topics:
  - "How to never forget document renewals"
  - "Visa expiration reminders"
  - "Subscription renewal alerts"
- Evergreen content
- Long-tail keywords

#### 2. Directories & Listings
- Product Hunt
- SaaS directories
- Immigrant / freelancer tool lists

#### 3. Email Virality (Built-in)
- Observers receive alerts
- Forward-email feature spreads organically

---

### Secondary Channels (Post-launch)

- Partnerships with accountants, lawyers, agencies
- Newsletter sponsorships
- Light paid search for high-intent keywords

---

## 8. Activation Strategy

### First-Session Goal

User must:
- Add at least one expiration
- Or forward one email

Activation messaging focuses on:
- Safety
- Calm
- Immediate value

---

## 9. Retention Strategy

Retention is driven by **reliability**, not engagement.

Key levers:
- Accurate alerts
- Low false positives
- Trust in email communication

Success = user forgets the product exists until it matters.

---

## 10. Churn Strategy

### Expected Churn Drivers
- User feels they "don’t need it anymore"
- Expirations were one-time only

### Mitigations
- Read-only access after cancelation
- Easy export (PDF)
- Soft reminders before churn

---

## 11. Expansion Strategy

Future expansion paths:
- Higher horizon limits
- Team accounts
- Compliance-oriented plans
- Vertical-specific bundles (immigration, SMB compliance)

Upsell is intentional but non-aggressive.

---

## 12. Launch Strategy

### Phase 1 – Private Alpha
- Small group (20–50 users)
- Validate alert accuracy
- Measure forward-email usage

### Phase 2 – Public Soft Launch
- Landing page
- Content publishing
- Invite-based onboarding

### Phase 3 – Public Launch
- Product Hunt
- Community sharing
- Directory submissions

---

## 13. Marketing Tone & Brand

Brand personality:
- Calm
- Trustworthy
- Human
- Non-technical

Avoid:
- Fear-based messaging
- Compliance jargon
- Aggressive sales language

---

## 14. KPIs & Metrics

### Core Metrics
- Trial → paid conversion
- Churn rate
- Alerts delivered vs opened
- Forward-email adoption

### North Star Metric

> % of users who successfully receive and act on an expiration alert

---

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|----|----|
| Users forget to add data | Forward-email feature |
| Low perceived value | Clear alert timing |
| Trust issues | Conservative automation |
| Price sensitivity | Annual discount |

---

## 16. Strategic Positioning

Expiration Guardian is not a productivity tool.

It is:
- A **peace-of-mind service**
- A **background assistant**
- A **low-effort safety net**

This positioning guides all future decisions.

---

**Expiration Guardian v1** is designed to grow quietly, reliably, and profitably through trust and volume—not hype.
